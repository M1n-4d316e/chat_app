# M1n chat_app
This is my local chat app.

There's a **[Dummy chat](https://m1n-4d316e.github.io/chat_app/) (Non-functional)** that lack the server side, it's only the front, for you to see. Usually takes a wile to charge.

## Install instructions

#### Server

npm install socket.io
```

#### Front

## Configuration
